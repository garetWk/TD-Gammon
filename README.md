# TD-Gammon

>>Description
Backgammon involves as large as 10^20 states. Thus it is impossible to have a table based Reinforcement Learning. I have instead used a Neural Network with hand-crafted features to represent the model. The weights are updated by the process of Temporal Difference Learning. To run the TD-Learning algorithm run:
#TD_Gammon
The final learned parameter is also provided in case you only wish to run the game.

>>Running Game
To play the game with the computer, run the line given below on the command line.
#GameSimulation
The output of the codes is farely self explanatory which one can easily understand if one goes through the codes, specially TD_Gammon code. All the codes are well commented, so i strongly feel that it will be a smooth journey. 

# Enjoy!!
